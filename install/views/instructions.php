<h3 class="title_h3">PHPCHESS INSTALLATION - INSTRUCTIONS</h3>

<h3>Thank you for choosing phpChess. We hope you enjoy the experience.</h3>
<p class="p">phpChess 4.2 is our first html5/javascript centric release. Please note that some of the settings you select here are extremely critical to the performance of your server. phpChess is designed for small top medium group sizes and should not be used in very large communities (we would not go beyond 1000 active users, unless we had a dedicated server).</p>
<br/>
<p class="p">Please make sure that you copied all files in the phpChess folder to your server, and that you changed the access right (CHMOD) to 755 for the bin directory. Most importantly please create a mysql database (preferably named 'phpchess') and create a user for this database, that has read and write permissions to this database. Please make sure you remember the password for this user, as you will need it in the following steps.</p>
<br/>
